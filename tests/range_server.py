range_server.py — a throwaway HTTP server for testing fetch_weights.sh.

The standard library's http.server answers 200 to a Range request and
sends the whole file, which is exactly the case the download script must
not silently accept. This serves a directory with real 206 responses, or
with Range support switched off, so both branches of the worker's resume
logic can be exercised without touching the network.

  python3 tests/range_server.py DIR PORT [--no-range] [--port-file F]

PORT 0 asks the kernel for a free one, which is what the caller should
use: a hardcoded port is a check that fails on any machine already running
something there, and it fails as "resume" rather than as "that port is
taken". --port-file is how the caller learns which port it got.

    HTTPServer.server_bind calls socket.getfqdn() on the address it just
    bound, and TCPServer.__init__ runs it *between* bind() and the listen()
    in server_activate. For 127.0.0.1 the answer is worth nothing — nothing
    here reads server_name — but on a macOS CI runner it blocked for about
    fifteen seconds, and until it returns the port is bound and not yet
    listening, so a caller connecting in that window is refused rather than
    queued. It also delayed the port file below past the caller's patience:
    the first server of a run failed to report in time, the second was fast
    because the resolver had cached the answer by then.
