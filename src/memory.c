/* waste_physical_ram() answers "how big is this machine". On Linux that is
 * sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES), which reads the host's MemTotal even when the
 * process is confined to a fraction of it, so a container gets the wrong
 * number by the whole ratio between the host and its limit. The automatic
 * budget then sizes against RAM it will never be allowed to touch — a
 * 32 GiB cgroup on a 256 GiB host asks for floor + 3x and is killed. That
 * is not the paging cliff of docs/LEARNED.md §16: nothing degrades, the
 * kernel simply kills the process, and no cache policy can soften it.
 *
 * So the ceiling becomes min(physical, cgroup limit) and everything
 * downstream is unchanged. What enters here is capacity only — the same
 * kind of number as physical RAM, fixed for the life of the process.
 * Current pressure (MemAvailable, memory.current) deliberately does not:
 * it moves between the read and the allocation, and a budget resolved once
 * at open cannot track it. Bounding a long-lived allocation by an
 * instantaneous reading makes the same command on the same machine two
 * different runs.
 *
 * memory.high counts as a limit alongside memory.max. It is the reclaim
 * threshold rather than a kill threshold, which makes it the closer
 * analogue of §16: a group allowed to exceed it is a group whose expert
 * cache the kernel takes back, and a hit that costs a page fault is worse
 * than the pread it replaced.
