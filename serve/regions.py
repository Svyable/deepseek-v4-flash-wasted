regions.py — reading K3's reply back into reasoning, answer and tool calls.

serve/xtml.py is the port of encoding_k3.py, which only encodes. The model
answers in the same markup, and something has to turn

    <|open|>think<|sep|> …reasoning… <|close|>think<|sep|>
    <|open|>response<|sep|> …answer… <|close|>response<|sep|>
    <|open|>tools<|sep|>
      <|open|>call tool="get_weather" index="1"<|sep|>
        <|open|>argument key="city" type="string"<|sep|>Paris<|close|>argument<|sep|>
      <|close|>call<|sep|>
    <|close|>tools<|sep|>

back into `reasoning_content`, `content` and OpenAI `tool_calls`. That is
this file, and it is the half upstream leaves to the host.

It is a streaming parser, because the server has to emit SSE deltas while
the model is still talking: feed as many chunks as you like, then finish().

There are two ways to feed it, and they are not equally good.

**feed_token(id, piece)** — what the server uses. A marker counts as
structure only when it arrived as its own control token id, which the
engine reports for every token it generates. This is the output-side twin
of the tokenize / tokenize_markup split on the input side, and it exists
for the same reason: a model that writes the *characters* `<|sep|>` inside
a tool argument — because a user asked it to quote one — must not thereby
close the element. At the token level the two are simply different ids and
the question does not arise.

**feed(text)** — for hosts that only have text, and for the goldens. It
finds markers by scanning, so it cannot tell a real `<|sep|>` from a model
that spelled one out; text that looks like markup is treated as markup.
Correct for every reply that does not talk about the markup, ambiguous for
the ones that do. Chunk boundaries fall anywhere, including inside a
marker, so text is held back until it is known not to start one.

Robustness is deliberate on both paths. The parser is fed model output,
which is a prediction and not a guarantee: an unterminated element, a
`<|close|>` for something that was never opened, an `argument` outside a
`call`, a reply that stops mid-marker because it hit the token limit. Every
one of those ends as text or as a dropped element, never as an exception —
a truncated answer is still worth returning.
