requant_vision.py — rewrite the vision tower at 8 bits, in place.

The converter quantizes everything outside the expert banks the same way,
which for the text trunk is a measured 11.8% weight error the model was
trained to survive. The vision tower was not: it is 27 layers deep, its
position embedding is a learned spatial prior, and at 4 bits the damage
measures 17.9% on the packed QKV and 12.6% on the position embedding.
Implementing the ViT on those weights would produce garbage indis-
tinguishable from a bug in the implementation.

Rather than reconvert a 982 GB container to fix 223 MB, this appends
requantized payloads to trunk.bin and repoints the manifest at them. The
old bytes stay where they are — dead weight in the file, not in RAM, and
the file is append-only so an interrupted run leaves the container intact
until the manifest is replaced atomically at the end.
