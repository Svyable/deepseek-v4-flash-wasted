fuzz_container.py — feed the engine broken containers and insist it says no.

A container is an untrusted input: docs/FORMAT.md says so, and the manifest
is JSON parsed by hand while the banks are binary records full of offsets
the engine follows. The failure that matters is not a wrong answer, it is
a read outside a buffer, so this is worth most when run against an
instrumented build — `make fuzz-asan`.

Structure-aware rather than random: it starts from a valid container
(tools/make_test_container.py) and breaks one thing at a time — a JSON
field retyped or moved out of range, an offset pointed past the end, a
file truncated mid-record, bytes flipped in a header, every record of one
bank damaged at once. Purely random bytes would be rejected by the JSON
parser before reaching anything interesting.

Each case is run twice: `waste info`, which parses the manifest and opens
every bank, and then a forward pass, which is the only thing that reads an
expert record and therefore the only thing that reaches the record header
checks and the checksum.

A clean rejection is a pass. A nonzero exit is a pass. Being killed by a
signal is a failure, and so is hanging.
